# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining whether a piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This can be applied to various domains like product reviews, social media posts, and customer feedback.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze text data and classify it into three sentiment categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**. The machine learning model is trained on a labeled dataset containing text samples with their corresponding sentiment labels.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization to prepare the data for machine learning models.
- **Model Selection**: Implemented various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
- **User Interface**: A simple command-line interface (CLI) or web app (optional) for users to input text and receive sentiment predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
- **Flask** or **Streamlit** (optional for web interface)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sangameshbagewadi/sentimental-analysis-using-machine-learning.git
